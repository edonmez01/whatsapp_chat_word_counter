# whatsapp_chat_word_counter
A very simple piece of code that counts the number of each word in a WhatsApp chat.

The user has to edit the first two lines of the code in order to specify the input and output text file paths. The input file must be a text file exported directly from WhatsApp, and the output file must be a blank text file.
